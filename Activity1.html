        <p>Space exploration is super important because it's how humans try to learn more about the universe outside of Earth. We
        send amazing rockets and spacecraft into space to visit places like the Moon and Mars, and to study distant stars and
        galaxies.</p>

        <p>This research helps us understand how the universe began and if there might be life elsewhere. Plus, building all the
        cool technology needed for space travel, like the International Space Station (ISS) or powerful telescopes, leads to new
        inventions that we use on Earth every day, from better weather forecasting to advanced medical tools</p>
